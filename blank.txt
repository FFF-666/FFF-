On January 29, 2020, I saw this book in this library, and I plan to keep a little record .... Recently, a new type of coronavirus broke out in China, which is relatively infectious. It has infected thousands of people and killed 100.  There are many people, and China is actively responding.  I just came back from China and went to school to report, but because of the plague, I had to rest at home for two weeks to observe the illness and spend the possible incubation period of the virus. Boring, so came to the library with another classmate. Hope the epidemic ends soon
